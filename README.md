# Freesewing patterns

An overview of sewing patterns available for [the JavaScript version of freesewing](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing).

> #### Note: menswear/womenswear has nothing to do with gender
>
> Freesewing is gender-neutral. When we use the terms **menswear** or **womenswear**
> we are not talking about clothes for men or women. It is merely a category of clothing
> much like **accessories** or **shoes** are categories.
>
> The category gives you an idea what to expect, and is there to help you find things.
> It is not a limitation, or even a suggestion, of what you can or should wear or make.
>
> Wear whatever you want, and be proud of the things you make.
